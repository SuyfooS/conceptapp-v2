# packages/db

Typed access to the database: generated types now, server queries as the
screens that need them arrive. Import as `@db/<file>`.

- The schema is plain SQL in `supabase/migrations/` (one file per change,
  never edited after it is merged).
- `database.types.ts` is generated from the local database with
  `pnpm db:types`. Never edit it by hand; CI fails if it is out of date.
- The RLS tests (pgTAP) live in `supabase/tests/database/` and run with
  `pnpm db:test`.

## Access rules

Every tenant table carries `business_id`. Row-level security filters on it
through helpers in the `private` schema (not exposed by the Data API):

| Helper | True when the signed-in user… |
| --- | --- |
| `private.is_member(business)` | has an active membership in the business |
| `private.has_role(business, min_role)` | has at least that role (owner > manager > worker) |
| `private.has_perm(business, perm)` | holds the permission (owners hold all) |
| `private.module_enabled(business, key)` | (any user) the module is switched on for the business |
| `private.is_viewing(business, min_role)` | is on the ConceptApp team with an open "view as" session in the business, at that role or above (read policies only) |

Writes to businesses' structure (memberships, modules, invites, templates,
audit log) go through server code with `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`. So do a
business's own details: `public.set_business_details(actor, business, patch)`
saves its name, colour, address and Shabbat city for an owner, a manager or the
team, and logs what changed. So does a profile (`20261109000400_profile_about.sql`):
`public.set_own_profile(actor, patch)` changes the signed-in person's own name,
language, line about themselves, cover and form of address, and
`public.clear_profile_bio(actor, business, person, seen)` lets an owner or
manager delete a hurtful line, the one they read (`seen`; a line rewritten
since stays, with 40001), logged as `profile.bio_cleared` without the text.
From the browser, reads follow the policies and nothing writes a profile.

The audit log is the business's activity log. Only server functions write it,
each for its own action (`business.details`, `module.settings`, `clock.correct`,
`clock.confirm` from `confirm_time_entry`, `clock.code.locked`,
`schedule.publish`, `swap.approve` and the rest). Owners and managers read their
own business's rows, and so does the team while viewing it as a manager or owner.
Publishing a week's schedule logs its first day, the number of shifts, whether it
was the first time, and how many waiting swap requests the old shifts took with
them (`activity_log.test.sql`).

The tests that must always pass: a member of business A cannot read
business B; anonymous visitors read nothing; every table in `public` has RLS.

## Templates

A business starts from a template (`restaurant`, `cafe-bar`): rows in
`templates`, written by migrations (a change is a new migration that updates
the row and bumps `version`). The definition's shape is `templateDefinition`
in `@domain/templates`: modules with `enabled` and their settings (positions
and the weekly shift pattern are scheduling settings), plus the opening hours.
A module the template doesn't name starts off, with its defaults, so a module
built for one business touches no template.

`public.apply_template(business, template)` copies one into a business
that has none yet, in one transaction: a `business_modules` row per module,
`opening_hours`, `template_key` and `template_version`. It refuses a
business that is already set up, an unknown key, or a template that names a
module nobody has, and changes nothing then. Only `service_role` may run it;
from TypeScript, `applyTemplate(adminClient, id, key)` in `@db/templates`.

Tested twice: pgTAP (`templates.test.sql`: grants, refusals, nothing
half-applied) and `pnpm test:db` (`modules/templates.db.test.ts`: each
template in the database is valid against the real manifests, and applying
it to a fresh business gives back the same valid definition). The seed makes
the demo restaurant and the demo shop with `reset_demo_business`, which applies
their templates; `demo_reset.test.sql` tests the reset and the shop's renewed
week.

## Wording

A template or a business can replace a whole sentence of the app's copy
(`template_wording`, `business_wording`), keyed by its message key under
`app.*` or `modules.*`. A business's sentence wins over its template's, which
wins over messages/he.json; deleting a row brings back the layer below.
Template sentences are read live through `businesses.template_key`, so a
change reaches every business opened from the template at once (Orel,
7 November 2026). Members read their own business's sentences and its
template's under RLS, and the team while viewing; only the team writes, with
`set_business_wording` (platform staff) and `set_template_wording` (platform
admins), each logging `wording.change`. Seeds hold no wording, so screens
read as messages/he.json. Console reads and writes are in `@db/wording`;
`wording.test.sql` covers who reads and writes what.

## Clients and session

- `@db/supabase/server`: `createClient()` for Server Components and Server
  Actions, acting as the signed-in person under RLS (publishable key).
- `@db/supabase/proxy`: `refreshSession()` for the root `proxy.ts`, which
  refreshes the session cookies on every app request.
- `@db/session`: `getCurrentMember()`, the signed-in person and their
  business. `app/(app)/member.ts` wraps it in React `cache()`.
- `@db/supabase/admin`: `createAdminClient()` with `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`,
  for server-only writes. Bypasses RLS, so every caller checks who is
  asking first.
- `@db/admin`: the console's reads and writes. `createBusiness(actor,
  business)` calls `public.create_business` (service role only): it opens
  the business, applies its template and writes `business.create` to the
  audit log in one transaction, and refuses an actor who is not platform
  staff. A taken slug comes back as `slugTaken`.
- `@db/env`: the public settings and the secret key, checked with Zod.

Sign-in is phone + SMS code. Accounts are never created at sign-in
(`[auth] enable_signup = false`); people arrive through the seed now and
through invites from chunk 1d. Locally and in CI the `send_sms` auth hook
writes codes to `dev.sms_codes` (defined in `supabase/seed.sql`, so it never
reaches a real project); the Playwright test reads them from there.
